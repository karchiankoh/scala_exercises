Q1. Use a trait to define a generic queue of strings with 'put' and 'get' methods, and create a class that implements it using an array. Include tests.


Q2. Starting from the previous exercise, use a trait to modify the behavior of 'put' so it reverses each string before adding it to the queue. Include tests.


Q3. Write the ~= operator for comparing doubles. The operator should return true iff 2 doubles are equal up to a small constant. The constant should be configurable but also have a default. Include tests.


Q4. Implement GCD in Scala (hint: use pattern matching and tail recursion)


Q5. Write a clause that measures the run time of a block of code and prints it (also needs to return the original output of the block):

```
timeit {
    ...
    ...
}
```


Q6. Given a string containing words separated by space, find:

- The longest word
- The most common word
- The most common letter
- Create a map from letter to a set of words it appear in


Q7. Convert a list of strings to a list of all the characters in all the strings


Q8. Given the following code:

```
trait IntSet {
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean
}
class EmptySet extends IntSet {
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean = false
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet = new NonEmptySet(x, new EmptySet, new EmptySet)
}
class NonEmptySet(elem: Int, left: IntSet, right: IntSet) extends IntSet {
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean =
        if (x < elem) left contains x
        else if (x > elem) right contains x
        else true
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet =
        if (x < elem) new NonEmptySet(elem, left incl x, right)
        else if (x > elem) new NonEmptySet(elem, left, right incl x)
        else this
}
```

Write methods union and intersection to form the union and intersection between two sets. Add a method

```
def excl(x: Int)
```

to return the given set without the element x. To accomplish this, it is useful to also implement a test method

```
def isEmpty: Boolean
```

for sets.


Q9. Consider the following definitions representing trees of integers. These definitions can be seen as an alternative representation of IntSet:

```
 abstract class IntTree
 case object EmptyTree extends IntTree
 case class Node(elem: Int, left: IntTree, right: IntTree) extends IntTree
```

Complete the following implementations of function contains and insert for IntTreeâ€™s.

```
def contains(t: IntTree, v: Int): Boolean = t match { ...
      ...
}
def insert(t: IntTree, v: Int): IntTree = t match { ...
      ...
} 
```


Q10. Consider a function which squares all elements of a list and returns a list with the results. Complete the following two equivalent definitions of squareList.

```
def squareList(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
       case List() => ??
       case y :: ys => ??
 }
 def squareMapList(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] =
       xs map ??
```


Q11. Write a function that gets an optional x,y and z and returns the first that is not None


Q12. Given a list:List[Int] and map:Map[Int, Double], multiply all the numbers in the list with their corresponding value in the map, and drop if don't exists

for example: list = [1,2,3,4], map = {1 -> 3, 3-> 5} ==> res = [3.0, 15.0]



Q13. Write a retry method that converts a method to a retry-able method.
the syntax should look like:

```
retry { ... }
```

However, you also need some way to specify how many times to retry and support sleep between retries (hint: implicit arguments)


Q14. Design a class that is given a vector of numbers in the constructor and exposes:

- x: a vector with the square of all elements in the input vector
- y: the sum of x
- z: the square root of y

nothing should be calculated in the constructor of the class assume the calculation of x,y,z can take a lot of time, and should only be done once (at most)


Q15. Add a method "median" to a Seq of integers so that s.median is the median of s for s of type Seq[Int]

- How can you add the same method for a sequence of doubles with minimal code duplication?
